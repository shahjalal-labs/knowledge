### confusion

> Diagnostic kits, Supplements are these products? if products then it's coming based category as web has supplement page and Diagnostic kits page separately=> if this okay then again why sorting category as it create issue that is kit page will show supplement data and vice versa

> warehouse & country field not taking from product creation

> Med Ai-Rapid Test page ( selections sort by is it from backend? ) ans: no backend exist> done by front end

> Research & Development page & it's details page (is this static page) : static done by front end

> Add to cart & Check out page (You May Also Like is this dynamic or static)

> is cart data store in backend> no handled from front end

> checkout page delivery information. is it every time coming from user manual input > it's coming from db, shipping address model

> Contact Us page flow clarification> taking details and storing (currenlty not doing anything more)

> order tracking flow clarification> is it manual tracking by admin> estimated delivery time how coming > ans: manual tracking
