> `how to "drain the shallows":
`

- Schedule every minute of your day: Use "time-blocking" so you are intentional about what you are doing.

* Quantify the "depth" of your tasks: Ask yourself: "How many months would it take a smart college grad with no specialized training to do this task?" If the answer is "a few weeks," it’s shallow work.

* Set a "shallow work budget": Decide what percentage of your day is allowed to be shallow (e.g., only 20%).

* Become harder to reach: Use "sender filters" on your email so people only message you if it's truly necessary.
