How does a person say “thank you” when there are
so many people to thank? Obviously this book is a
thank you to my two fathers, who were powerful role
models, and to my mom, who taught me love and
kindness.
The person most responsible for this book
becoming a reality is my wife Kim—my partner in
marriage, business, and in life. She makes my life
complete.
